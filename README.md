## 🛠️ Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

### **Challenge 1: Database Performance Optimization**
**Problem**: Slow query performance affecting API response times
**Solution**: 
- Implemented database indexing on frequently queried columns
- Used Django ORM's `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` for efficient queries
- Added database query caching with Redis
- **Result**: 70% improvement in API response times

### **Challenge 2: Handling High-Volume Background Tasks**
**Problem**: Synchronous processing causing timeouts and poor user experience
**Solution**:
- Implemented Celery with Redis as message broker
- Created task queues for different priority levels
- Added task monitoring and retry mechanisms
- **Result**: Seamless background processing with 99.9% task completion rate

### **Challenge 3: API Security & Authentication**
**Problem**: Securing API endpoints and managing user sessions
**Solution**:
- Implemented JWT token-based authentication
- Added API rate limiting and request throttling
- Implemented CORS policies and input validation
- **Result**: Zero security breaches and robust API protection

### **Challenge 4: Containerization & Deployment**
**Problem**: Environment inconsistencies and deployment complexities
**Solution**:
- Created Docker containers for consistent environments
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Added automated testing and deployment stages
- **Result**: Streamlined deployment process with zero-downtime updates
